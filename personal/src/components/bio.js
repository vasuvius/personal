                Hi! Welcome to my site. I'm Jack Vasu, a Dartmouth College '22 currently based in San Francisco. 
                I majored in Computer Science with a minor in Environmental Studies. Originally from Boston, I love to play tennis, 
                hike, travel, and play chess. After college I went on a two month trip to Europe and Southeast Asia with a few friends. Take a look below!
